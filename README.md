# MailApp

This is MailApp Web-application. I developed this by using NodeJS, Express Js and for database i use MySQL.

In MailApp, I used modules like 'express-session' to maintain session and 'express-fileupload' to upload an
image and used more packages like mysql, body-parser, hbs etc.

To install any modules in your project- Firstly open cmd prompt on your project location folder and then run
command- 'npm i module_name'

To run these project on your system before opening project- Go to roject location where you put it and open 
cmd prompt and run command - 'npm install'. By which all modules install automatically from package-lock.json 
by using this command.

package-lock.json is a json file which kept information about installed package in your project.

To build package-lock.json file in your project you have to go with two steps-
step:1 - Before starting your project, open cmd prompt on project location and run command- 'npm init'. this 
         will make your file package-lock.json and then..
step:2 - After that you are free to install any module package-lock.json file store information of every package 
that you installed.
